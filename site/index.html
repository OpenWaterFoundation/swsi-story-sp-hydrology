              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - The Hydrologic Cycle</h2>			  
			  <p>Hydrology is the study of water.</p>
			  <p>As a science, hydrology has evolved in response to the need to understand Earth's complex water systems and help solve water problems.  
			  The supply of water available for human use is limited by nature.  Although there is plenty of water on Earth, it is not always in the right 
			  place at the right time and of the right quality.</p>
			  <p>Hydrology encompasses the occurrence, distribution, movement and properties of water and its relationship with the environment within 
			  each phase of the hydrologic cycle, shown at right.  The hydrologic cycle, or water cycle, is a continuous process by which water is purified 
			  by evaporation and transported from the Earth's surface (including the oceans) into the atmosphere and back to the land and oceans.  All of 
			  the physical, chemical and biological processes involving water as it travels its various paths in the atmosphere (e.g., condensation and 
			  precipitation), over and beneath the Earth's surface (e.g., infiltration and snowmelt runoff) and through growing plants (e.g., transpiration) 
			  are studied.</p>
			  <p>There are many pathways water may take in its continuous cycle of falling as rainfall or snowfall and returning to the atmosphere. Water may 
			  be captured for millions of years in polar ice caps. It may flow to rivers and finally to the sea. It may soak into the soil to be evaporated 
			  directly from the soil surface as it dries or be transpired by growing plants. It may percolate through the soil to ground water reservoirs 
			  (aquifers) to be stored or it may flow to wells or springs or back to streams by seepage. The cycle for water may be short or it may take millions 
			  of years.</p>
			  <p><i>~ From the <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html" target="_blank">USGS Water Science School</a>.</i></p>
			  <p>Hydraulics, a related field, is the study of the conveyance of water or other liquids through pipes or channels.  Hydraulic 
			  concepts include pipe flow, dam design, turbines, hydropower, flow measurement and river channel erosion.  Free surface hydraulics is the branch 
			  of hydraulics dealing with flows that occur in rivers, canals and lakes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Hydrographs</h2>			  
			  <p>In Colorado, average annual statewide precipitation is 16 inches, with most regions receiving 12-16 inches.  The mountainous areas of the state 
			  receive more water.  Most areas above 10,000 feet in elevation receive 25 inches or more annually, mostly in the form of snow.  The snowpack typically 
			  builds up in the early spring from storms originating in the Pacific Ocean that move eastward.  The snowpack begins to melt in April and feeds 
			  into the State’s rivers.  Peak runoff from snowmelt occurs in May and June.  According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), 
			  approximately 80% of river runoff comes from snowmelt.  The remainder comes from rainfall and infiltration from groundwater (
			  <a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" 
			  target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.4-6).</p>
			  <p>The amount of snow and rain that feeds into rivers varies within a single year and also from year to year.  Hydrographs summarize river flows 
			  over a period of time.  More specifically, hydrographs show the rate of flow (discharge) versus time past a specific point in a river, 
			  typically a streamgage (discussed in a later section).  The rate of flow is typically expressed in cubic feet per second (cfs).  This graphic 
			  shows five annual hydrographs from a streamgage on Boulder Creek.  Each line represents a year of flow and shows the variability that can 
			  occur from year to year.</p>

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Streamgages and Measuring Flows</h2>			  
			  <p>In order to manage the water resources of Colorado it is necessary to measure the surface water flow in natural streams and water distribution 
			  infrastructure.  Streamflow, also called discharge, in Colorado is measured by the <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/sw" 
			  target="_blank">U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)</a>, <a href="http://www.dwr.state.co.us/Surfacewater/default.aspx" target="_blank">Colorado Division of 
			  Water Resources (DWR)</a>, local water utilities and other entities that need to know flow amounts for reporting and operations.  Sensors and 
			  data loggers (also called data collection units (DCUs) or stage discharge recorders (SDRs)) may record measurements frequently, which are referred 
			  to as instantaneous measurements and can be triggered by changing values.  Data are often reported at 15-minute intervals, representing average conditions over that 
			  time.  These values are then aggregated to longer intervals including hour and day.  Average values are often suitable for water supply management 
			  operations, whereas instantaneous values may be used for peak flows or other critical conditions.</p>  
			  <p>It is important to recognize that a daily average flow, such as reported by USGS or DWR, does not mean that the flow was the same from midnight 
			  to midnight; in actuality, the flow could have varied significantly during the day and using shorter-interval data is necessary to understand the 
			  variation.</p>  
			  <p>Each organization that collects data assigns a station identifier and name to the station.  Multiple data sources, identifier conventions and 
			  data formats can present challenges to finding and using data.</p>

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Diversion Headgates and Measuring Diversions</h2>			  
			  <p>To divert water from a river into a ditch or canal, diversion structures are installed in the river.  Structures divert water for several reasons: 
			  to directly deliver water to agricultural land, to carry water to other ditches, to divert water into a storage reservoir or to deliver water for 
			  other purposes such as for municipal use.  Structures can be in the form of dams, pumps and headgates.  Headgates are typically metal gates that are 
			  raised and lowered to allow a controlled amount of water to flow into a ditch or canal.  Diversion structures are identified using a Water District 
			  Identifier (WDID) and each diversion structure has one or more water rights that indicate seniority, use type and amount.</p>
			  <p>Measurement of diversions occurs in various ways.  Larger diversion structures may include a measurement structure such as a weir which, in 
			  combination with a water level sensor and rating to convert water level (stage) to flow (discharge), provides a reasonable estimate of the diversion 
			  amount.  Many large diversion structures now have telemetered automated data measurement.  Similar to streamflow, diversion measurements may be available
			  as real-time data (15-minute or hourly) or as longer intervals that are typically used for historical data analysis.</p>

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Natural vs. Regulated Flows</h2>
			  <p>Streamflows can represent various conditions.  Natural flow is streamflow absent the impacts of humans (no reservoirs, no diversions, etc.).  
			  Natural streamflow can only be measured where human impacts are absent, such as headwater basins.  Regulated flow is streamflow that is impacted 
			  by humans and corresponds to streamgage measurements that are commonly reported.  In the <a href="#hydrographs">Hydrographs</a> page of this story, 
			  hydrographs represent the natural hydrologic system (as compared to ditches or canals), but it should be understood that the flows that are measured 
			  are considered regulated flows.</p>
			  <p>Natural flow can be estimated from regulated flow by removing human impacts.  For example, natural flow can be estimated by subtracting reservoir 
			  releases and adding back in diverted flows from ditches and canals.  The calculations can be more complex if all hydrologic inputs are considered, 
			  such as agricultural return flows, evaporation from reservoirs, wastewater treatment plan returns, etc.</p>
			  <p>Analyses of water supplies and the effects of climate change on streamflow are just a couple of ways in which it may be necessary to estimate 
			  natural or regulated flows.  Estimation of natural flows typically requires utilizing models. Two examples are point flow models and the CDSS 
			  StateMod model, which will be discussed in the next section.</p>

              <h2>Modeling Concepts - Point Flow Models</h2>
			  <p>A point flow model is a modeling technique for representing the water balance in a hydrologic system, where calculations are performed at a point
			  in time across all locations in the model.  Relatively simple water balance calculations are used to account for diversions and inflows between known 
			  flow points, typically streamgages.  Point flow models are appropriate for performing simple basin modeling.  The streamflow at every stream 
			  gage in the basin is represented in the analysis for a specific point in time.</p>
			  <p>Point flow models are usually constructed as a system, or network, of nodes and links.  The inputs throughout the basin are used to add and subtract 
			  flows to perform a water balance.  The data outputs from one timestep are then used as inputs across the basin for the next timestep.</p>
			  <p>Point flow models will typically result in errors because of externalities, timing issues and data input errors, which can generally be represented 
			  as gains and losses between nodes.  The errors can be distributed between nodes in a reach, where a reach is bounded by stream gages.  The distribution 
			  of errors can be based on stream mile or other mechanism.</p>

              <h2>Modeling Concepts - CDSS and StateMod</h2>
			  <p>Colorado’s Decision Support Systems (CDSS) <a href="http://cdss.state.co.us/Modeling/Pages/SurfaceWaterStateMod.aspx" target="_blank">StateMod</a> model 
			  is a tool that represents a river basin using constructs that closely match the water rights system in Colorado.  The model represents a river system using 
			  a network of nodes, called stations (i.e., streamgage, diversion and well stations).  The nodes in the model are associated with other data files, including water 
			  rights, return flow tables and time series files indicating historical diversions, demands, etc.  StateMod also includes features to represent real-world 
			  operational constructs such as exchanges, augmentation plans and terms and conditions.</p>
			  <p>StateMod datasets are created to represent Colorado’s basins to help with planning studies such as evaluating major system changes and climate change.  
			  StateMod models are driven by natural streamflow estimated from regulated streamflow, diversions and reservoir releases.  Natural streamflows represent water 
			  inputs, rather than using precipitation and rainfall/runoff.  Consequently, StateMod is a complex accounting model that takes into account the stream network, 
			  physical and legal components.  StateMod models are typically developed at a monthly timestep, but daily models can be created by estimating daily input time 
			  series.  StateMod is a complex tool that requires expertise to run.  Output is extensive, consisting of large text reports and data files that require 
			  additional processing to retrieve data.</p>
			  <p>A StateMod model has been developed for the <a href="http://cwcbweblink.state.co.us/WebLink/0/doc/204368/Electronic.aspx?searchid=2f720c2b-71a7-451b-8a49-342a8bd21902" 
			  target="_blank">South Platte Basin</a>.  This map shows approximately 500 of the over 1,400 nodes that make up the South Platte Basin StateMod model network.  
			  The nodes shown here consist primarily of stream gages, diversions, reservoirs and wells.</p>
			  <p>StateMod models are being used in the <a href="http://cwcb.state.co.us/water-management/water-supply-planning/Documents/SWSI2016/FactSheets/6_WaterSupply.pdf" 
			  target="_blank">Statewide Water Supply Initiative (SWSI) Update</a> to estimate current and future available water supplies.</p>

              <h2>Hydrology Tools - Source Water Route Framework</h2>
			  <p>A dataset that has recently been developed by DWR is the Source Water Route Framework (SWRF), which is a spatial data layer representing 
			  most streams in Colorado, in particular those with water rights or other important features.  SWRF is derived from the USGS's 
			   <a href="https://nhd.usgs.gov/NHD_High_Resolution.html" target="_blank">National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)</a>, which is available 
			  at several scales.  A Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) ID, an 8-digit identifier, is used to uniquely identify most streams in the 
			  state, rather than using the stream's common name (there are 13 streams named Dry Creek in the South Platte basin alone).</p>
			  <p>By using the NHD linked to Colorado water data, it is possible to link federal and State datasets.  Datasets such as 
			  stream gages, diversion structures and instream flow rights can be "referenced" to the SWRF to provide a common framework for analysis; 
			  such data work is ongoing in order to leverage the SWRF dataset.</p>
			  <p>The SWRF can be downloaded <a href="http://cdss.state.co.us/GIS/Pages/AllGISData.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			  <p><i>Map of SWRF will be shown at right.  <b>File size is 25 MB though.</b></i></p>
