              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - The Hydrologic Cycle</h2>			  
			  <p>Hydrology is the study of water.</p>
			  <p>As a science, hydrology has evolved in response to the need to understand Earth's complex water systems and help solve water problems.  
			  The supply of water available for human use is limited by nature.  Although there is plenty of water on Earth, it is not always in the right 
			  place at the right time and of the right quality.</p>
			  <p>Hydrology encompasses the occurrence, distribution, movement and properties of water and its relationship with the environment within 
			  each phase of the hydrologic cycle, shown at right.  The hydrologic cycle, or water cycle, is a continuous process by which water is purified 
			  by evaporation and transported from the Earth's surface (including the oceans) into the atmosphere and back to the land and oceans.  All of 
			  the physical, chemical and biological processes involving water as it travels its various paths in the atmosphere (e.g., condensation and 
			  precipitation), over and beneath the Earth's surface (e.g., infiltration and snowmelt runoff) and through growing plants (e.g., transpiration) 
			  are studied.</p>
			  <p>There are many pathways water may take in its continuous cycle of falling as rainfall or snowfall and returning to the atmosphere. Water may 
			  be captured for millions of years in polar ice caps. It may flow to rivers and finally to the sea. It may soak into the soil to be evaporated 
			  directly from the soil surface as it dries or be transpired by growing plants. It may percolate through the soil to ground water reservoirs 
			  (aquifers) to be stored or it may flow to wells or springs or back to streams by seepage. The cycle for water may be short or it may take millions 
			  of years.</p>
			  <p><i>~ From the <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html" target="_blank">USGS Water Science School</a>.</i></p>
			  <p>Hydraulics, a related field, is the study of the conveyance of water or other liquids through pipes or channels.  Hydraulic 
			  concepts include pipe flow, dam design, turbines, hydropower, flow measurement and river channel erosion.  Free surface hydraulics is the branch 
			  of hydraulics dealing with flows that occur in rivers, canals and lakes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Hydrographs</h2>
			  <p>Hydrographs summarize river flows over a period of time, using a “time series” of data.  A time series is a time-ordered sequence of dates 
			  (possibly also with time of day) with corresponding data values.  Hydrographs provide a way to understand variation, trends and relationships 
			  in water data.  Other data types can be similarly graphed, but the word “hydrograph” is typically used when presenting water depth, flow and/or 
			  volume over time.</p>
			  <p>In Colorado, average annual statewide precipitation is 16 inches, with most regions receiving 12-16 inches.  The mountainous areas of the state 
			  receive more water.  Most areas above 10,000 feet in elevation receive 25 inches or more annually, mostly in the form of snow.  The snowpack typically 
			  builds up in the early spring from storms originating in the Pacific Ocean that move eastward.  The snowpack begins to melt in April and feeds 
			  into the State’s rivers.  Peak runoff from snowmelt occurs in May and June.  According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), 
			  approximately 80% of river runoff comes from snowmelt.  The remainder comes from rainfall and infiltration from groundwater (
			  <a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" 
			  target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.4-6).</p>
			  <p>Understanding snowmelt amount and timing is critical to water resources planning.  The amount of snow and rain that feeds into rivers varies 
			  within a single year and also from year to year.  Hydrographs show the rate of flow (discharge) versus time past a specific point in a river, 
			  typically a streamgage (discussed in a later section).  The rate of flow is typically expressed in cubic feet per second (cfs).</p>  
			  <p>This interactive visualization shows five annual hydrographs from a streamgage on Boulder Creek.  Each line represents a year of flow data and 
			  shows the variability that can occur from year to year.  To select/deselect years on the plot, click on the year in the legend at the bottom.  
			  Note that even though these years represent a wide range of flows observed on Boulder Creek at this location, flows are most variable from 
			  mid-April to August.</p>

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Variability</h2>
			  <p>Hydrologic variability occurs across space and time.  Within the South Platte Basin, flows can vary between sub-basins within the same 
			  year, with one sub-basin experiencing drought and another experiencing adequate water supplies.  Variation can occur because of elevation, 
			  regional weather patterns, water storage projects, impacts of specific storm events and other reasons.</p>  
			  <p>This interactive visualization shows annual flow volume in acre-feet from 1950 to 2011 for 33 streamgages in the basin, representing the South Platte River and 
			  many of its tributaries.  Streamgages on the South Platte River are ordered from upstream to downstream and tributaries are generally arranged 
			  in order from where their confluences are with the South Platte River.  Within a streamgage, average volumes are ranked and placed into 
			  percentile categories as follows:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li><span style="color:#b30000;">Less than 10<sup>th</sup> percentile = Much Below Normal</span></li>
			    <li><span style="color:#fe9929;">10<sup>th</sup> - 24<sup>th</sup> percentile = Below Normal</span></li>
			    <li><span style="color:green;">25<sup>th</sup> - 75<sup>th</sup> percentile = Normal</span></li>
			    <li><span style="color:#6baed6;">76<sup>th</sup> - 90<sup>th</sup> percentile = Above Normal</span></li>
			    <li><span style="color:#08519c;">Greater than 90<sup>th</sup> percentile = Much Above Normal</span></li>				
			  </ul>
			  <p>It is important to recognize that the data used in an analysis can be impacted by human actions.  Streamgage measurements reflect the 
			  impacts of diversions, reservoir releases and other impacts.  Therefore, evaluating streamgage data also indirectly reflects other conditions 
			  in the basin.  Annual data can also be impacted by extreme events.  For example, a streamgage may indicate drought conditions for the majority 
			  of the year and one large rain event may skew the annual result (i.e., the September 2013 flood event centered on the Colorado Front 
			  Range).  It may be necessary to view data at finer detail, such as a monthly interval, to fully understand conditions.  Fully understanding 
			  drought conditions requires evaluation of <a href="#storagesnowpack">snowpack</a>, precipitation, <a href="#naturalflows">natural flows</a>

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Streamgages and Measuring Flows</h2>			  
			  <p>In order to manage the water resources of Colorado it is necessary to measure the surface water flow in natural streams and water distribution 
			  infrastructure.  Streamflow, also called discharge, in Colorado is measured by the <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/sw" 
			  target="_blank">U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>,

			  Water Resources (DWR)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, local water utilities and other entities that need to know flow amounts for reporting and operations.  Sensors and 
			  data loggers (also called data collection units (DCUs) or stage discharge recorders (SDRs)) may record measurements at regular intervals and can be 
			  triggered by changing values such as a rain event.  These measurements, often referred to as real-time or instantaneous, may or may not be publicly 
			  available.  Data are often reported at 15-minute intervals, representing average conditions over that time.  These values are then aggregated to 
			  longer intervals including hour and day.  Average values are often suitable for water supply management operations, whereas instantaneous values 
			  may be used for peak flows or other critical conditions.</p>  
			  <p>It is important to recognize that a daily average flow, such as reported by USGS or DWR, does not mean that the flow was the same from midnight 
			  to midnight; in actuality, the flow could have varied significantly during the day and using shorter-interval data is necessary to understand the 
			  variation.</p>  
			  <p>Each organization that collects data assigns a station identifier and name to the station.  Multiple data sources, identifier conventions and 
			  data formats can present challenges to finding and using data.</p>

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Diversion Headgates and Measuring Diversions</h2>			  
			  <p>To divert water from a river into a ditch or canal, diversion structures are installed in the river.  Structures divert water for several reasons: 
			  to directly deliver water to agricultural land, to carry water to other ditches, to divert water into a storage reservoir or to deliver water for 
			  other purposes such as for municipal use.  Structures can be in the form of dams, pumps and headgates.  Headgates are typically metal gates that are 
			  raised and lowered to allow a controlled amount of water to flow into a ditch or canal.  The amount diverted depends on the water needed at that time 
			  and location, adherence to Colorado water law priority system and river conditions.  Water may not be physically available if the river flow is low 
			  and may not be taken if flows are extremely high and may damage infrastructure.  Diversion structures are identified using a Water District 
			  Identifier (WDID), consisting of a two-digit water district identifier and five-digit structure identifier.  Each diversion structure has one or more 
			  water rights that indicate seniority, use type and amount.</p>
			  <p>Measurement of diversions occurs in various ways.  Larger diversion structures may include a measurement structure such as a weir which, in 
			  combination with a water level sensor and rating to convert water level (stage) to flow (discharge), provides a reasonable estimate of the diversion 
			  amount.  Many large diversion structures now have telemetered automated data measurement.  Similar to streamflow, diversion measurements may be available
			  as real-time data (15-minute or hourly) or as longer intervals that are typically used for historical data analysis.  The accuracy of diversion 
			  measurement will depend on the measurement device design and calibration and can be impacted by sediment, flow impediments such as tree trunks, 
			  technology issues and degradation of the infrastructure, such as settling, cracking and vegetation growth.  <a href="http://www.dwr.state.co.us/SurfaceWater/data/division.aspx?div=1" 
			  target="_blank">Diversion records<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> maintained by DWR indicate how much water was 
			  measured (or estimated) to have been diverted at a structure.</p>
			  <p>This map shows ditch diversion structures in the Basin, of which there are over 3,500 (note these are just ditch diversions and not diversions for 
			  other structure types, such as wells).  Structures are color-coded based on water source:  the 10 streams with the most diversions are colored and listed

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Groundwater and Measuring Water Level</h2>
			  <p>Groundwater is water that is held underground within aquifers, which are geological formations (essentially rock or soil layers).  The water is 
			  contained within tiny pore spaces or cracks in the solid material.  There are three types of aquifers:  alluvial, sedimentary bedrock and fractured rock.  
			  Alluvial aquifers are generally composed of shallow sand and gravel deposits.  They are often also called tributary aquifers because they exchange 
			  water with surface streams.  Groundwater in alluvial aquifers is recharged by the infiltration of rain and snowmelt through the soil.  Seepage from 
			  irrigation canals and reservoirs and inflows from nearby aquifers also contribute water.  The South Platte Alluvial Aquifer is one of the largest 
			  and most utilized alluvial aquifers in Colorado (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" 
			  target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.15-16).</p>
			  <p>Sedimentary bedrock aquifers occur deep underground primarily in sandstone and limestone.  These types of aquifers are not often hydraulically 
			  connected to nearby streams.  They still have recharge areas like alluvial aquifers, but these may be many miles from the actual aquifer.  Deep 
			  aquifers require long periods of time to recharge – potentially thousands of years.  The Denver Basin aquifer system is an example of a sedimentary bedrock aquifer
			  (Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From, p.17).</p>
			  <p>Fractured rock aquifers occur in bedrock that contains cracks and fractures due to the folding and faulting of the rock over millions of years.  
			  These types of aquifers are common in mountainous areas.  Springs occur where fractures in the rock intersect the surface (Citizen's Guide to Where 
			  Your Water Comes From, p.19).</p>
			  <p>Groundwater is used for city water supplies, industry, irrigation, rural domestic use and livestock watering.  The State Engineer has estimated 
			  that about 2 million acre-feet of groundwater is pumped and used annually, which amounts to approximately 20% of all water used in Colorado 
			  (Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From, p.29).</p>
			  <p>Groundwater from aquifers is made accessible to users via wells.  Groundwater use is administered and enforced by the <a href="http://water.state.co.us/groundwater/Pages/default.aspx"

			  are over 13,000 wells in the South Platte Basin alone.  (Click on the Map tab to see locations in the Basin).  Wells are numerous because they 
			  allow easy access to water.  Wells are often drilled in locations that are convenient to farms and homes, whereas surface water may be located much 
			  farther away.</p>
			  <p>Small wells, such as domestic wells, are constructed after obtaining a well permit and have limited size (50 gallons per minute or less).  Larger

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Return Flows</h2>
			  <p>It may seem as though water is continuously removed from streams for agricultural, municipal and other uses and therefore the amount of water 
			  in a stream decreases as one moves downstream.  However, water that is diverted for municipal, industrial or agricultural purposes that is not 
			  consumed returns to rivers and/or aquifers by surface flows or underground flows.  For example, the U.S. Geological Survey has estimated that 
			  approximately only 37% of the water diverted statewide for agriculture is actually consumed 
			  (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" 
			  target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.12).</p>
			  <p>These surface and underground flows are collectively called return flows and can be used by downstream water users.  Types of return flows 
			  include runoff and infiltration from agricultural lands, runoff and infiltration from lawns and landscaping and returns from wastewater treatment 
			  plants or industry.  Irrigation return flows, in particular, are often reused multiple times. Unless a municipality relies exclusively on groundwater 
			  or its water supply comes directly from a river’s headwaters, its supply includes reused water.  The term “direct reuse” indicates wastewater 
			  that is directly used for municipal supply and “indirect reuse” indicates mixing wastewater with other supplies.  Many cities in Colorado rely 
			  on reused (or recycled) water (Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From, p.24;

			  agriculture and other purposes.  In general, municipalities seek cleaner water supplies, which often means acquiring mountain supplies.  In some 
			  cases, exchanges can occur, for example, allowing a municipality to use cleaner mountain water supplies in exchange for an equivalent amount of

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Natural, Regulated and Available Flows</h2>
			  <p>Streamflows can represent various conditions.  Regulated flow is streamflow that is impacted by humans and corresponds to streamgage measurements 
			  that are commonly reported.</p>  
			  <p>Natural flow is streamflow absent the impacts of humans (no reservoirs, no diversions, etc.).  Natural streamflow can only be <i>measured</i> where 
			  human impacts are absent, such as headwater basins.  Natural flow can be <i>estimated</i> from regulated flow by removing human impacts. For example, 
			  natural flow can be estimated by subtracting reservoir releases and adding back in diverted flows from ditches and canals. The calculations can be 
			  more complex if all hydrologic inputs are considered, such as return flows, evaporation from reservoirs, losses to groundwater aquifers, etc.</p>
			  <p>Available flow is water that has not been allocated at a point in time and space. For example, high flows in spring may provide enough water to 
			  meet all water demands considering water law and excess water is available for additional use.  This condition is called “free river” and means that 
			  there will be no calls on the river to curtail junior water rights.  Available flow may be available at any time when the river can meet all water 
			  demands.  In a planning study, the amount of available flow indicates the opportunity for additional water development, such as building a reservoir 
			  to store the available flow, or implementing an instream flow right to preserve environmental flows.</p>
			  <p>Hydrographs (see the <a href="#hydrographs">Hydrographs</a> page of this story), can be used for natural, regulated or available flows, as well as 
			  any other subset or aggregation of flow data.  The interactive hydrographs at right are for two locations on the South Platte River:  higher up in the 
			  basin near Elevenmile Canyon Reservoir and near the stateline at Julesburg.</p>
			  <p>Analyses of water supplies and the effects of climate change on streamflow are a couple of ways where it may be necessary to estimate 
			  natural flows.  Estimation of natural flows and understanding conditions in a system typically require utilizing models. Two examples are point flow 
			  models and the CDSS StateMod model, which will be discussed in the next section.</p>

              <h2>Modeling Concepts - Point Flow Models</h2>
			  <p>A point flow model is a modeling technique for representing the water balance in a hydrologic system, where calculations are performed at a point
			  in time across all locations in the model.  Relatively simple water balance calculations are used to account for diversions and inflows between known 
			  flow points, typically streamgages.  Point flow models are appropriate for performing simple basin modeling where routing of flow over time can be 
			  ignored.  The streamflow at every stream gage in the basin is represented in the analysis for a specific point in time.</p>
			  <p>Point flow models are usually constructed as a system, or network, of nodes and links.  The inputs throughout the basin are used to add and subtract 
			  flows to perform a water balance.  The data outputs from one timestep are then used as inputs across the basin for the next timestep.</p>
			  <p>Point flow models will typically result in errors because of externalities such as unmeasured inflows and outflows, timing issues and data input errors, 
			  which can generally be represented as gains and losses between measured streamgage nodes.  The errors can be distributed between nodes in a reach, where 
			  a reach is bounded by streamgages.  The distribution of errors can be based on stream mile or other mechanism.  For example, if the point flow calculations 
			  between two streamgages indicate that flow at the lower gage is 100 cfs higher than calculated, the 100 cfs can be distributed across the stream reach 
			  between gages, indicating that return flows are occurring.  Such return flows vary depending on season and are themselves lagged in time from the original 
			  use of the water.  Point flow models therefore provide a useful conceptualization of a system without having to model complex interactions.</p>

			  rights system in Colorado.  The model represents a river system using a network of nodes, called stations (i.e., streamgage, diversion and well stations).  
			  The nodes in the model are associated with other data files, including water rights, return flow tables and time series files indicating historical diversions, 
			  demands, etc.  StateMod also includes features to represent operational constructs such as exchanges, augmentation plans, terms and conditions and many other 
			  operations.</p>
			  <p>StateMod datasets are created to represent Colorado’s basins to help with planning studies such as evaluating major system changes and climate change.  
			  StateMod models are driven by natural streamflow estimated from regulated streamflow, diversions and reservoir releases.  Natural streamflows represent water 
			  inputs, rather than using precipitation and rainfall/runoff.  Consequently, StateMod is a complex accounting model that takes into account the stream network, 
			  physical and legal components.  StateMod models are typically developed at a monthly timestep, but daily models can be created by estimating daily input time 
			  series.  StateMod is a complex tool that requires expertise to run.  Output is extensive, consisting of large text reports and data files that require

              <h2>Water Demands - Agriculture</h2>
			  <p>Understanding current and future available water supplies requires understanding the demands that are placed on those supplies.  Various 
			  entities compete for the Basin's water resources and these entities need water at different times of the year.  Agriculture is the largest user of the Basin's 
			  water resources, accounting for 85% of total water diversions (<a href="https://www.colorado.gov/cowaterplan" 
			  target="_blank">Colorado Water Plan<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.3-13).</p>  
			  <p>Agricultural demand for water is typically from May to October.  Irrigation requirements vary depending on the crop that is grown.  Crop irrigation 
			  requirements are defined as the depth of water needed to meet the water consumed through evapotranspiration by a disease-free crop, growing in large fields 
			  under non-restricting soil conditions including soil water and fertility, and achieving full production potential under the given growing environment.  
			  The table below lists water requirements for crops grown in eastern Colorado.  In general, alfalfa requires the most water, followed by sugar beets (Source: <a href="
			  http://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/agriculture/seasonal-water-needs-and-opportunities-for-limited-irrigation-for-colorado-crops-4-718/" target="_blank">CSU 
			  Extension Fact Sheet: Seasonal Water Needs and Opportunities for Limited Irrigation for Colorado Crops)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" 
			  width="12px"/></a>.</p>
			  <p><img class="image-centered" src="images/crop-requirements.png" frameborder="0"></img></p>
			  <p>Agricultural producers rely on various data to help make decisions about the upcoming irrigation season, including reservoir storage conditions, snowpack 
			  conditions, water rental programs and other information.  Water use for each agricultural producer and ditch system depends on the location, conditions 
			  and operations of the system, as well as the seniority of their water rights.  This interactive visualization shows diversion records for five ditches in 
			  the Basin and illustrates some conditions and circumstances under which ditches divert water for agricultural purposes.</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li><span style="color:#6baed6;">Brantner Ditch</span>:  this is an example of a ditch with senior water rights that is able to support the same use nearly 
				every year because of those senior rights.  To clearly see this, click on the other ditch names in the legend to "turn off" those ditches so that only 
				Brantner Ditch is shown.  Also note that the ditch starts diverting water around the first of April each year.</li>
			    <li><span style="color:green;">Riverside Canal</span>:  this is an example of a ditch that supplements its supply with reservoir storage.  This type of ditch 
				can irrigate at "normal" levels, even in drought.</li>
			    <li><span style="color:#08519c;">Harmony Ditch</span>:  this example ditch highlights innovation.  This ditch has junior water rights, yet 
				has changed irrigation methods (flood to sprinkler) and the type of crops grown to increase the certainty of producing crops even when water short.</li>
			    <li><span style="color:#fe9929;">Big Thompson Ditch & Manufacturing Company</span>:  this is an example of a ditch that has rights to Colorado-Big Thompson 
				(transbasin) water and no independent, off-channel storage.</li>
			    <li><span style="color:#b30000;">S. Boulder Canon Ditch</span>:  this is an example of a ditch that frequently experiences shortages.  Not only does this ditch 
				divert less water than the other four ditches shown, but it diverts over a shorter time period.  Each year, the ditch diverts water for about two months.</li>				
			  </ul>
			  <p>Water rights that are used for irrigated agriculture can be transferred to other uses such as municipal use.  In this case, only the consumptive use portion of 
			  the decree can be transferred to the new use and average historical return flows must be maintained to minimize impacts to downstream water users.  Estimating the 
			  historical consumptive use based on historical weather data, crops and irrigation practices requires analysis, such as the CDSS

              <h2>Water Demands - Municipalities and Industry</h2>
			   <p>Municipalities and industry are a second category of demand placed on the Basin's water resources.  Municipal and industrial water demand tends to be 
			   fairly predictable from year to year and season to season in a general sense, although variation does occur.  Municipal water demand is fairly constant 
			   throughout the year for indoor use but greatly increases for outdoor use in the summer months to water landscaping.  Variation from year to year depends 
			   on weather and over time is impacted by long-term drivers.  Variation within a year depends on weather and specific events.</p>  
			   <p>Water supply planning is typically framed by short-term planning (which considers system water supply firm yield and storage, infrastructure 
			   projects that might disrupt supply, short-term disasters, etc.) and long-term planning (which considers population growth, changes in efficiency, climate 
			   change, etc.).  Planning involves understanding risk (quantifying loss) and uncertainty (recognizing multiple possible outcomes).  Drought planning typically 
			   takes into consideration that a system has the ability to supply water for a certain amount of time to meet normal demands and that extreme conditions, if 
			   severe enough,  will result in changes such as water restrictions.  For example, a utility may be able to provide normal water deliveries for three years even 
			   if a 1-in-50-year drought is occurring.  A normal level of operations allows customers to behave normally and ensures a normal level of revenue for the utility.</p>
			   <p>System reliability and long-term planning typically involve analysis and modeling where multiple scenarios are used as input to understand potential impacts.  
			   For example, the worst historical drought (based on low streamflows, snowpack, etc.) may be used as input to a model of the current system to determine whether 
			   additional water supplies or changes to operations are needed.  Based on the analysis, a water provider such as a utility may decide to acquire additional water 
			   supplies as an insurance policy to decrease the certainty of a negative impact, thus reducing risk.  Each water provider must perform their own analysis based on 
			   their water supply portfolio and local conditions.  In Colorado, the worst situation is when a statewide drought occurs that impacts many basins.</p>
			   <p>The interactive visualization at right shows the indoor and outdoor water demands of Denver, Aurora and Boulder.  The hydrographs (from StateMod) clearly 
			   show that water use almost doubles in the summer months for these large municipalities.</p>

              <h2>Water Demands - Environment and Recreation</h2>
			  <p>Environmental and recreational needs are a third category of demand placed on the Basin's water resources, but in this case, the demand is to keep water 
			  in the river and other water bodies.  The <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/SouthPlatteBasinImplementationPlan-04172015.pdf" 
			  target="_blank">South Platte Basin Implementation Plan (BIP)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> (p.2-25) describes the environmental 
			  and recreational attributes that are important to the Basin.  These include the protection of habitat for fish species like greenback cutthroat trout and 
			  plains fish species like plains minnow, common shiner and stonecat, to name a few.  Non-fish species that are considered important include species like 
			  boreal toad, yellow mud turtle and river otter.  Recreational activities that are considered important to the Basin include fishing and both flatwater and 
			  whitewater boating.  Protection of the riparian plant community is also important to the Basin.  Protection and enhancement of the environment has a direct 
			  economic impact as well as contributing to the characteristics of Colorado that residents value and expect.</p>
			  <p>The protection of these varied environmental and recreational attributes corresponds to the protection of flows that meet these attributes' needs.  For 
			  example, many fish species require a range of flows to thrive.  Flushing (high) flows move sediment downstream, create new habitat and can be cues to spawn.  
			  The life stage of the species (larval, juvenile or adult) can also determine the necessary flows.  All species need some minimum flow that will ensure they 
			  have adequate habitat to survive.  Species can survive low flows and variation in flows but can be severely impacted by conditions in which the magnitude,
			  timing, and/or persistence of flows are outside of biologically-tuned ranges.  It is a challenge to quantify required flows for each species and therefore 
			  indicator species are often used to monitor and evaluate habitats.</p>
			  <p>For a given stream reach, the flows necessary to protect environmental and recreational uses can be highly varied and also vary within a year.  This interactive 			  
			  visualization shows the flows needed for some environmental and recreational attributes on the South Platte River below Chatfield Reservoir, as well as the 
			  streamflow that was actually present during that time.  
			  (Source: <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/Appendix%20D%20-%20Environmental%20and%20Recreational%20Assessment%20Methodology%20and%20Framework.pdf" 
			  target="_blank">South Platte BIP Appendix D-2 - Environmental and Recreational Assessement Methodology and Framework<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png"

			  is focusing on the development of a Flow Tool, along with an update to the Environmental and Recreational database.  This tool

			  flow needs and if those flow needs are being met.</p>

			  <p>As mentioned previously, approximately 80% of river runoff comes from snowmelt.  Snowpack is essentially a one-year storage 
			  reservoir and has the benefit of being a natural, high-elevation and generally high-quality supply.  The amount of water that is 
			  generated by the melting of the snowpack is vital for water managers to understand because they must predict yearly water supplies
			  for homes, businesses, farms, etc.  Snowpack is measured by the NRCS’s National Water and Climate Center and a network of Snow Telemetry 
			  <a href="https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/" target="_blank">(SNOTEL)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> 
			  stations.  Automated remote sensing equipment at these stations (which are located throughout the western U.S.) measure real-time snow 
			  and climate data, in particular snow water equivalent (SWE), which is the depth of liquid water contained within the snowpack at a 
			  location.  The data are available in hourly, daily, monthly and yearly increments; cumulative values can be compared with historical data.

              <h2>Storage - Reservoirs</h2>
			  <p>As has been shown, various users of the Basin's water resources need water at different times of the year and in different amounts.  
			  If left to its own means, the snowpack that begins to melt in April would run off quickly into Colorado's rivers and out of the state.  Dry 
			  conditions during the most of the year produce little water in rivers during the summer and winter months.  Historically, the South Platte River 
			  naturally dried up for extended stretches during the late summer and early autumn months 
			  (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" 
			  target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.26).  
			  Reservoirs are constructed to maintain a consistent supply of water for municipal, industrial, agricultural and sometimes environmental and 
			  recreational uses.  Reservoirs essentially regulate river flows:  they can increase low flows during dry conditions and reduce flooding flows.</p>
			  <p>Some reservoirs are operated primarily for drought reserve and can remain substantially full until needed.  Other reservoirs are operated 
			  primarily for irrigation and tend to fill in non-irrigation months and drain each year during the irrigation season.  Some reservoirs may also 
			  provide flood storage, meaning that the reservoir is kept partially empty in order to store flood flows.  New reservoirs and changes to existing 
			  reservoirs often seek to meet multiple purposes in order to maximize benefits of storage, although adding significant storage to provide 
			  environmental flows is a challenge.</p>
			  <p>Reservoirs also provide operational flexibility.  For example, a reservoir may release water to meet return flow obligations directly 
			  (rather than delayed returns from recharge ponds).  Systems that include multiple reservoirs can support exchanges where releases from an 
			  upstream reservoir can be provided to an upstream entity in exchange for releases from a downstream reservoir to meet the demands of a downstream 
			  entity, although this practice can deplete the intervening reach.  Conversely, an upstream reservoir may release water to a downstream reservoir 
			  while improving flows in the intervening reach.  Reservoirs may include gravel pits.  Consequently, an entity such as municipal utility may own 
			  storage reservoirs that are below the intakes to their water treatment plants, in order to provide options within the region.</p>
			  <p>A condition for transbasin diversions may be the construction of a “compensatory storage” reservoir that benefits the originating basin, in 
			  which case storage is used to provide supply that might originally have come from the natural river.  Transbasin diversions often also include 
			  storage in the receiving basin in order to re-time flows to meet demands over an entire year.</p>
			  <p>Reservoirs may be constructed on channel or off channel.  Resistance to on-channel reservoirs has resulted in new storage projects often being 
			  designed as off-channel locations or the expansion of existing on-channel reservoirs.  Off-channel reservoirs may require pumping.  New reservoirs 
			  often include hydropower generation in order to generate electricity and revenue.</p>
			  <p>Reservoirs do have issues, including concerns about depleting river flows in order to fill reservoirs, losses due to evaporation from reservoir 
			  surfaces, climate impacts of energy use to pump water into storage, changes in water quality and temperature and other issues.  These factors and 
			  others are considered during the permitting process for a new reservoir.</p>

              <h2>Storage - Groundwater</h2>
			  <p>Water can also be stored underground in aquifers.  One benefit to underground storage is that it can have less of an environmental impact compared 
			  to constructing a new surface reservoir.  Underground reservoirs also experience little or no evaporation, although plants with long roots can 
			  extract water from underground storage.</p>
			  <p>Alluvial aquifers near the South Platte River and its tributaries are actively used and the relationship between surface and ground water is managed 
			  according to Colorado water law.  Most well water rights are junior to surface water rights.  Agricultural producers may prefer to use wells because 
			  water can be pumped when needed and may be of higher quality than surface water.  In order to pump out of priority, a well must be part of an 
			  <a href="http://water.state.co.us/groundwater/GWAdmin/Pages/AugPlans.aspx" target="_blank">augmentation plan<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> 
			  that replaces the out-of-priority depletion and its impact on the river with some other source, such as releases from a reservoir.  The pumping impact 
			  on the river is not instantaneous and may, in fact, need to be paid back over many years as part of the augmentation plan.</p>			  
			  <p>Denver Water is undertaking an Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) study to determine locations where it can potentially inject treated drinking 
			  water into underlying aquifers for use in the future.  During periods of abundant water supply, Denver Water would take drinking water from 
			  water mains and inject it into wells in the Denver Basin aquifer system.  The same wells would then pump the water back up from the aquifers when 
			  drier conditions are present.</p>
			  <p>This short video from Denver Water describes more about the ASR project.  More information can also be found at

			  <p>Transbasin diversions divert water across watershed boundaries, taking water from one stream or river and conveying it into an entirely different 
			  watershed. The largest transbasin diversions in Colorado divert water from the west side of the Continental Divide to the east side.  Transbasin 
			  diversions have been constructed because while 80% of the State's precipitation falls on the West Slope of the Continental Divide, about 90% of the

              <h2>Drought</h2>
			  <p>Drought is a shortage of water associated with a lack of precipitation. It occurs when the normal amount of moisture required to satisfy an 
			  area’s usual water consumption is unavailable.  Drought can appear slowly and last for many years or it can be a short-lived "flash drought" 
			  event.  It can occur locally, regionally or statewide.  Drought is a regular feature of Colorado's climate but can be very destructive without 
			  adequate planning, response and mitigation.  Planning is necessary so that when a drought-induced water supply shortage exists, water providers 
			  can take actions to lessen the impacts.</p>

			  <p>In 2014, the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB) released a report titled <a href="http://wwa.colorado.edu/climate/co2014report/Climate_Change_CO_Report_2014_FINAL.pdf" 
			  target="_blank">"Climate Change in Colorado:  A Synthesis to Support Water Resources Management and Adaptation"<img src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>.  
			  This, along with the <a href="https://issuu.com/cfwe/docs/cfwe_cc_cg_web" target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Colorado Climate Change<img 
			  src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> assess how climate change will affect Colorado's water resources.  Key points from the 
			  CWCB report include the following (p.1-4):</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">All climate model projections indicate future warming in Colorado. The statewide average annual temperatures are projected to warm by +2.5&#8457 
				to +5&#8457 by 2050 relative to a 1971–2000 baseline under a medium-low greenhouse-gas emissions scenario.  Under a high emissions scenario, the 
				projected warming is larger at mid-century (+3.5&#8457 to +6.5&#8457).</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">No long-term trends in average annual precipitation have been detected across Colorado, even considering the relatively dry period since 2000.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Climate model projections show less agreement regarding future precipitation change for Colorado.  The individual model projections of change 
				by 2050 in statewide annual precipitation range from -5% to +6% for one model and from -3% to +8% for another model.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">Snowpack, as measured by April 1 snow-water equivalent (SWE), has been mainly below-average since 2000 in all of Colorado’s river basins, 
				but no long-term (30-year, 50-year) declining trends have been detected.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Most model projections of Colorado’s spring snowpack show declines for the mid-21st century due to the projected warming.</li>				
				<li style="text-align:left;">The timing of snowmelt and peak runoff has shifted earlier in the spring by 1–4 weeks across Colorado’s river basins over the past 30 
				years, due to the combination of lower SWE since 2000, the warming trend in spring temperatures and enhanced solar absorption from dust-on-snow.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">The peak of the spring runoff is projected to shift 1–3 weeks earlier by the mid-21st century due to warming. Late-summer flows are 
				projected to decrease as the peak shifts earlier. Changes in the timing of runoff are more certain than changes in the amount of runoff.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">No long-term statewide trends in heavy precipitation events have been detected. The evidence suggests that there has been no statewide 
				trend in the magnitude of flood events, although climate change is expected to result in more intense storms.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">Nearly all of the model projections indicate increasing winter precipitation by 2050. There is weaker consensus among the projections 
				regarding precipitation in the other seasons.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">In the first projections of future Colorado hydrology based on the latest climate model output, most projections show decreases in 
				annual streamflow by 2050 for the San Juan and Rio Grande basins. The projections are more evenly split between future increases and decreases 
				in streamflow by 2050 for the Colorado Headwaters, Gunnison, Arkansas and South Platte basins. However, other hydrology projections show drier 
				outcomes for Colorado, and the <i>overall body of published research indicates a tendency towards future decreases in annual streamflow for all of 
				Colorado’s river basins</i>.</li>				
			  </ul>
			  <p>Increasing temperatures will have a significant impact on outdoor water use, irrigated agriculture, and natural vegetation water use, with some estimates of up 
				to 25% more demand, based on higher temperatures and a longer growing season (<b>need citation</b>).</p>
			  <p>It is difficult to fully quantify the impacts of climate change on water resources.  Systems models such as StateMod have been used to simulate river systems 
			  using a possible range of precipitation, temperature and related data, in order to understand impacts on water supplies (see the 
			  <a href="http://cwcbweblink.state.co.us/WebLink/ElectronicFile.aspx?docid=158319&searchid=78f0eafa-0b8f-4d8a-9ff3-faf67cc82f52&dbid=0" target="_blank">Colorado

			  width="12px"/></a>).  A general concern among municipal water providers is that the gains due to water conservation will be offset by the impacts of climate change 
			  and efforts to develop new water supplies must account not only for certain population growth but uncertain, yet significant, impacts of climate change.</p>

			  identify most streams in the state, rather than using the stream's common name (there are 13 streams named Dry Creek in the South Platte basin alone).</p>
			  <p>By using the NHD linked to the SWRF, it is possible to link federal and State datasets.  Datasets such as 
			  stream gages, diversion structures and instream flow rights can be "referenced" to the SWRF to provide a common framework for analysis; 
			  such data work is ongoing in order to leverage the SWRF dataset.</p>

			  <p>The CDSS SNODAS Tools, developed for the Colorado Water Conservation Board, provide access to a historical archive of Snow Data Assimilation 
			  System (SNODAS) data products for Colorado water supply basins.  SNODAS data are available for the entire state and are calculated from remote-sensed 
			  datasets using a grid across Colorado.  Consequently, SNODAS snowpack data are available at locations where SNOTEL is not available. 
			  <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/g02158SNODAS" target="_blank">SNODAS<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> data from 
			  the National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) are processed daily to calculate Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) and Snow Coverage 
			  statistics for water supply basins in Colorado. Snow Water Equivalent is the estimate of the depth of liquid water contained within the snowpack. 
			  Snow coverage is a percent of the basin land surface covered by snow (water bodies in the basin are ignored).  Mean SWE is displayed in the map using 
			  a legend similar to the National Weather Service.  Acre-feet estimates of available SWE for local basins and cumulative upstream basins can be used by 
			  water supply planners to better understand water supply conditions.</p>

			  produced jointly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Drought Mitigation 
			  Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (NDMC-UNL).  The map is based on measurements of climatic, hydrologic and soil conditions as well as 
			  reported impacts and observations from more than 350 contributors around the country.  To see a live version of the map shown at right, click 
			  <a href="http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?CO" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			  <p>Drought severity is <a href="http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/AboutUSDM/DroughtClassification.aspx" target="_blank">classified</a> as the following:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li>D0 - abnormally dry</li>
			    <li>D1 - moderate drought</li>
			    <li>D2 - severe drought</li>
			    <li>D3 - extreme drought</li>
			    <li>D4 - exceptional drought</li>
