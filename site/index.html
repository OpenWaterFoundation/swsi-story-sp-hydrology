              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - The Hydrologic Cycle</h2>			  
			  <p>Hydrology is the study of water.</p>
			  <p>As a science, hydrology has evolved in response to the need to understand Earth's complex water systems and help solve water problems.  
			  The supply of water available for human use is limited by nature.  Although there is plenty of water on Earth, it is not always in the right 
			  place at the right time and of the right quality.</p>
			  <p>Hydrology encompasses the occurrence, distribution, movement and properties of water and its relationship with the environment within 
			  each phase of the hydrologic cycle, shown at right.  The hydrologic cycle, or water cycle, is a continuous process by which water is purified 
			  by evaporation and transported from the Earth's surface (including the oceans) into the atmosphere and back to the land and oceans.  All of 
			  the physical, chemical and biological processes involving water as it travels its various paths in the atmosphere (e.g., condensation and 
			  precipitation), over and beneath the Earth's surface (e.g., infiltration and snowmelt runoff) and through growing plants (e.g., transpiration) 
			  are studied.</p>
			  <p>There are many pathways water may take in its continuous cycle of falling as rainfall or snowfall and returning to the atmosphere. Water may 
			  be captured for millions of years in polar ice caps. It may flow to rivers and finally to the sea. It may soak into the soil to be evaporated 
			  directly from the soil surface as it dries or be transpired by growing plants. It may percolate through the soil to ground water reservoirs 
			  (aquifers) to be stored or it may flow to wells or springs or back to streams by seepage. The cycle for water may be short or it may take millions 
			  of years.</p>
			  <p><i>~ From the <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html" target="_blank">USGS Water Science School</a>.</i></p>
			  <p>Hydraulics, a related field, is the study of the conveyance of water or other liquids through pipes or channels.  Hydraulic 
			  concepts include pipe flow, dam design, turbines, hydropower, flow measurement and river channel erosion.  Free surface hydraulics is the branch 
			  of hydraulics dealing with flows that occur in rivers, canals and lakes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Hydrographs</h2>			  
			  <p>In Colorado, average annual statewide precipitation is 16 inches, with most regions receiving 12-16 inches.  The mountainous areas of the state 
			  receive more water.  Most areas above 10,000 feet in elevation receive 25 inches or more annually, mostly in the form of snow.  The snowpack typically 
			  builds up in the early spring from storms originating in the Pacific Ocean that move eastward.  The snowpack begins to melt in April and feeds 
			  into the State’s rivers.  Peak runoff from snowmelt occurs in May and June.  According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), 
			  approximately 80% of river runoff comes from snowmelt.  The remainder comes from rainfall and infiltration from groundwater (
			  <a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" 
			  target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.4-6).</p>
			  <p>The amount of snow and rain that feeds into rivers varies within a single year and also from year to year.  Hydrographs summarize river flows 
			  over a period of time.  More specifically, hydrographs show the rate of flow (discharge) versus time past a specific point in a river, 
			  typically a streamgage (discussed in a later section).  The rate of flow is typically expressed in cubic feet per second (cfs).  This graphic 
			  shows five annual hydrographs from a streamgage on Boulder Creek.  Each line represents a year of flow and shows the variability that can 
			  occur from year to year.</p>

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Streamgages and Measuring Flows</h2>			  
			  <p>In order to manage the water resources of Colorado it is necessary to measure the surface water flow in natural streams and water distribution 
			  infrastructure.  Streamflow, also called discharge, in Colorado is measured by the <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/sw" 
			  target="_blank">U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)</a>, <a href="http://www.dwr.state.co.us/Surfacewater/default.aspx" target="_blank">Colorado Division of 
			  Water Resources (DWR)</a>, local water utilities and other entities that need to know flow amounts for reporting and operations.  Sensors and 
			  data loggers (also called data collection units (DCUs) or stage discharge recorders (SDRs)) may record measurements frequently, which are referred 
			  to as instantaneous measurements and can be triggered by changing values.  Data are often reported at 15-minute intervals, representing average conditions over that 
			  time.  These values are then aggregated to longer intervals including hour and day.  Average values are often suitable for water supply management 
			  operations, whereas instantaneous values may be used for peak flows or other critical conditions.</p>  
			  <p>It is important to recognize that a daily average flow, such as reported by USGS or DWR, does not mean that the flow was the same from midnight 
			  to midnight; in actuality, the flow could have varied significantly during the day and using shorter-interval data is necessary to understand the 
			  variation.</p>  
			  <p>Each organization that collects data assigns a station identifier and name to the station.  Multiple data sources, identifier conventions and 
			  data formats can present challenges to finding and using data.</p>

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Diversion Headgates and Measuring Diversions</h2>			  
			  <p>To divert water from a river into a ditch or canal, diversion structures are installed in the river.  Structures divert water for several reasons: 
			  to directly deliver water to agricultural land, to carry water to other ditches, to divert water into a storage reservoir or to deliver water for 
			  other purposes such as for municipal use.  Structures can be in the form of dams, pumps and headgates.  Headgates are typically metal gates that are 
			  raised and lowered to allow a controlled amount of water to flow into a ditch or canal.  Diversion structures are identified using a Water District 
			  Identifier (WDID) and each diversion structure has one or more water rights that indicate seniority, use type and amount.</p>
			  <p>Measurement of diversions occurs in various ways.  Larger diversion structures may include a measurement structure such as a weir which, in 
			  combination with a water level sensor and rating to convert water level (stage) to flow (discharge), provides a reasonable estimate of the diversion 
			  amount.  Many large diversion structures now have telemetered automated data measurement.  Similar to streamflow, diversion measurements may be available
			  as real-time data (15-minute or hourly) or as longer intervals that are typically used for historical data analysis.</p>

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Groundwater and Measuring Water Level</h2>
			  <p>Groundwater is water that is held underground within aquifers, which are geological formations (essentially rock layers).  The water is 
			  contained within tiny pore spaces or cracks in the rock.  There are three types of aquifers:  alluvial, sedimentary bedrock and fractured rock.  
			  Alluvial aquifers are generally composed of shallow sand and gravel deposits.  They are often also called tributary aquifers because they exchange 
			  water with surface streams.  Groundwater in alluvial aquifers is recharged by the infiltration of rain and snowmelt through the soil.  Seepage from 
			  irrigation canals and reservoirs and inflows from nearby aquifers also contribute water.  The South Platte Alluvial Aquifer is one of the largest 
			  and most utilized alluvial aquifers in Colorado (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" 
			  target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.15-16).</p>
			  <p>Sedimentary bedrock aquifers occur deep underground primarily in sandstone and limestone.  These types of aquifers are not often hydraulically 
			  connected to nearby streams.  They still have recharge areas like alluvial aquifers, but these may be many miles from the actual aquifer.  Deep 
			  aquifers require long periods of time to recharge – potentially thousands of years.  The Denver Basin aquifer system is an example of a sedimentary bedrock aquifer
			  (Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From, p.17).</p>
			  <p>Fractured rock aquifers occur in bedrock that contains cracks and fractures due to the folding and faulting of the rock over millions of years.  
			  These types of aquifers are common in mountainous areas.  Springs occur where fractures in the rock intersect the surface (Citizen's Guide to Where 
			  Your Water Comes From, p.19).</p>
			  <p>Groundwater is used for city water supplies, industry, irrigation, rural domestic use and livestock watering.  The State Engineer has estimated 
			  that about 2 million acre-feet of groundwater is pumped and used annually, which amounts to approximately 20% of all water used in Colorado 
			  (Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From, p.29).</p>
			  <p>Groundwater from aquifers is made accessible to users via wells.  Groundwater use is administered and enforced by the <a href="http://water.state.co.us/groundwater/Pages/default.aspx"

			  target="_blank">Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>shows that there 
			  are over 13,000 wells in the South Platte Basin alone.  (Click on the Map tab to see locations in the Basin).  Wells are numerous because they 
			  allow easy access to water.  Wells are often drilled in locations that are convenient to farms and homes, whereas surface water may be located much

			  <p>It may seem as though water is continuously removed from streams for agricultural, municipal and other uses and therefore the amount of water 
			  in a stream decreases as one moves downstream.  However, water that is diverted for municipal, industrial or agricultural purposes that is not 
			  consumed returns to rivers and/or aquifers by surface flows or underground flows.  For example, the U.S. Geological Survey has estimated that 
			  approximately only 37% of the water diverted statewide for agriculture is actually consumed

              <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Natural vs. Regulated Flows</h2>
			  <p>Streamflows can represent various conditions.  Natural flow is streamflow absent the impacts of humans (no reservoirs, no diversions, etc.).  
			  Natural streamflow can only be measured where human impacts are absent, such as headwater basins.  Regulated flow is streamflow that is impacted 
			  by humans and corresponds to streamgage measurements that are commonly reported.  In the <a href="#hydrographs">Hydrographs</a> page of this story, 
			  hydrographs represent the natural hydrologic system (as compared to ditches or canals), but it should be understood that the flows that are measured 
			  are considered regulated flows.</p>
			  <p>Natural flow can be estimated from regulated flow by removing human impacts.  For example, natural flow can be estimated by subtracting reservoir 
			  releases and adding back in diverted flows from ditches and canals.  The calculations can be more complex if all hydrologic inputs are considered, 
			  such as agricultural return flows, evaporation from reservoirs, wastewater treatment plan returns, etc.</p>
			  <p>Analyses of water supplies and the effects of climate change on streamflow are just a couple of ways in which it may be necessary to estimate 
			  natural or regulated flows.  Estimation of natural flows typically requires utilizing models. Two examples are point flow models and the CDSS 
			  StateMod model, which will be discussed in the next section.</p>

              <h2>Modeling Concepts - Point Flow Models</h2>
			  <p>A point flow model is a modeling technique for representing the water balance in a hydrologic system, where calculations are performed at a point
			  in time across all locations in the model.  Relatively simple water balance calculations are used to account for diversions and inflows between known 
			  flow points, typically streamgages.  Point flow models are appropriate for performing simple basin modeling.  The streamflow at every stream 
			  gage in the basin is represented in the analysis for a specific point in time.</p>
			  <p>Point flow models are usually constructed as a system, or network, of nodes and links.  The inputs throughout the basin are used to add and subtract 
			  flows to perform a water balance.  The data outputs from one timestep are then used as inputs across the basin for the next timestep.</p>
			  <p>Point flow models will typically result in errors because of externalities, timing issues and data input errors, which can generally be represented 
			  as gains and losses between nodes.  The errors can be distributed between nodes in a reach, where a reach is bounded by stream gages.  The distribution 
			  of errors can be based on stream mile or other mechanism.</p>

			  <p>Colorado’s Decision Support Systems (CDSS) <a href="http://cdss.state.co.us/Modeling/Pages/SurfaceWaterStateMod.aspx" target="_blank">StateMod</a> model 
			  is a tool that represents a river basin using constructs that closely match the water rights system in Colorado.  The model represents a river system using 
			  a network of nodes, called stations (i.e., streamgage, diversion and well stations).  The nodes in the model are associated with other data files, including water 
			  rights, return flow tables and time series files indicating historical diversions, demands, etc.  StateMod also includes features to represent real-world 
			  operational constructs such as exchanges, augmentation plans and terms and conditions.</p>
			  <p>StateMod datasets are created to represent Colorado’s basins to help with planning studies such as evaluating major system changes and climate change.  
			  StateMod models are driven by natural streamflow estimated from regulated streamflow, diversions and reservoir releases.  Natural streamflows represent water 
			  inputs, rather than using precipitation and rainfall/runoff.  Consequently, StateMod is a complex accounting model that takes into account the stream network, 
			  physical and legal components.  StateMod models are typically developed at a monthly timestep, but daily models can be created by estimating daily input time 
			  series.  StateMod is a complex tool that requires expertise to run.  Output is extensive, consisting of large text reports and data files that require 
			  additional processing to retrieve data.</p>
			  <p>A StateMod model has been developed for the <a href="http://cwcbweblink.state.co.us/WebLink/0/doc/204368/Electronic.aspx?searchid=2f720c2b-71a7-451b-8a49-342a8bd21902"

              <h2>Water Demands - Agriculture</h2>
			  <p>To further understand current and future available water supplies, it is necessary to understand the demands that are placed on those supplies.  Various 
			  entities compete for the Basin's water resources and these entities need water at different times of the year.  Agriculture is the largest user of the Basin's 
			  water resources (<a href="https://www.colorado.gov/cowaterplan" target="_blank">Colorado Water Plan<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>,

			  <p>Agricultural demand for water is typically from May to October...Crop irrigation requirements are defined as the depth of water needed to meet the water 
			  consumed through evapotranspiration by a disease-free crop, growing in large fields under non-restricting soil conditions including soil water and fertility, 
			  and achieving full production potential under the given growing environment.  Irrigation requirements vary depending on the crop that is grown.</p>

              <h2>Water Demands - Environment and Recreation</h2>
			  <p>Environmental and recreational needs are a third category of demand placed on the Basin's water resources, but in this case, the demand is to keep water 
			  in the river.  The <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/SouthPlatteBasinImplementationPlan-04172015.pdf" 
			  target="_blank">South Platte Basin Implementation Plan (BIP)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> (p.2-25) describes the environmental 
			  and recreational attributes that are important to the Basin.  These include the protection of habitat for fish species like greenback cutthroat trout and 
			  plains fish species like plains minnow, common shiner and stonecat, to name a few.  Non-fish species that are considered important include species like 
			  boreal toad, yellow mud turtle and river otter.  Recreational activities that are considered important to the Basin include fishing and both flatwater and 
			  whitewater boating.  Protection of the riparian plant community is also important to the Basin.</p>
			  <p>The protection of these varied environmental and recreational attributes corresponds to the protection of flows that meet these attributes' needs.  For 
			  example, many fish species require a range of flows to thrive.  Flushing (high) flows move sediment downstream, create new habitat and can be cues to spawn.  
			  The life stage of the species (larval, juvenile or adult) can also determine the necessary flows.  All species need some minimum flow that will ensure they 
			  have adequate habitat to survive.</p>
			  <p>For a given stream reach, the flows necessary to protect environmental and recreational uses can be highly varied and also vary within a year.  This graphic 
			  shows the flows needed for some environmental and recreational attributes on the South Platte River below Chatfield Reservoir, as well as the streamflow that 
			  was actually present during that time.  This example shows that environmental flushing flows were largely not met during 2004. (Source:

              <h2>Storage - Snowpack</h2>
			  <p>As mentioned previously, approximately 80% of river runoff comes from snowmelt.  Snowpack is essentially a one-year storage

			  generated by the melting of the snowpack is vital for water managers to understand because they must predict yearly water supplies
			  for homes, businesses, farms, etc.  Snowpack is measured by the NRCS’s National Water and Climate Center and a network of Snow Telemetry 
			  <a href="https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/" target="_blank">(SNOTEL)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>

			  CWCB report include the following (p.1-4):</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">All climate model projections indicate future warming in Colorado. The statewide average annual temperatures are projected to warm by +2.5&#8457 
				to +5&#8457 by 2050 relative to a 1971–2000 baseline under a medium-low greenhouse-gas emissions scenario.  Under a high emissions scenario, the 
				projected warming is larger at mid-century (+3.5&#8457 to +6.5&#8457).</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">No long-term trends in average annual precipitation have been detected across Colorado, even considering the relatively dry period since 2000.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Climate model projections show less agreement regarding future precipitation change for Colorado.  The individual model projections of change 
				by 2050 in statewide annual precipitation range from -5% to +6% for one model and from -3% to +8% for another model.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">Snowpack, as measured by April 1 snow-water equivalent (SWE), has been mainly below-average since 2000 in all of Colorado’s river basins, 
				but no long-term (30-year, 50-year) declining trends have been detected.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Most model projections of Colorado’s spring snowpack show declines for the mid-21st century due to the projected warming.</li>				
				<li style="text-align:left;">The timing of snowmelt and peak runoff has shifted earlier in the spring by 1–4 weeks across Colorado’s river basins over the past 30 
				years, due to the combination of lower SWE since 2000, the warming trend in spring temperatures and enhanced solar absorption from dust-on-snow.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">The peak of the spring runoff is projected to shift 1–3 weeks earlier by the mid-21st century due to warming. Late-summer flows are 
				projected to decrease as the peak shifts earlier. Changes in the timing of runoff are more certain than changes in the amount of runoff.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">No long-term statewide trends in heavy precipitation events have been detected. The evidence suggests that there has been no statewide 
				trend in the magnitude of flood events.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">Nearly all of the model projections indicate increasing winter precipitation by 2050. There is weaker consensus among the projections 
				regarding precipitation in the other seasons.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">In the first projections of future Colorado hydrology based on the latest climate model output, most projections show decreases in 
				annual streamflow by 2050 for the San Juan and Rio Grande basins. The projections are more evenly split between future increases and decreases 
				in streamflow by 2050 for the Colorado Headwaters, Gunnison, Arkansas and South Platte basins. However, other hydrology projections show drier 
				outcomes for Colorado, and the <i>overall body of published research indicates a tendency towards future decreases in annual streamflow for all of 
				Colorado’s river basins</i>.</li>

              <h2>Hydrology Tools - Source Water Route Framework</h2>
			  <p>A dataset that has recently been developed by DWR is the Source Water Route Framework (SWRF), which is a spatial data layer representing 
			  most streams in Colorado, in particular those with water rights or other important features.  SWRF is derived from the USGS's 
			  <a href="https://nhd.usgs.gov/NHD_High_Resolution.html" target="_blank">National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" 
			  width="12px"/></a>, which is available at several scales.  A Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) ID, an 8-digit identifier, is used to uniquely 
			  identify most streams in the state, rather than using the stream's common name (there are 13 streams named Dry Creek in the South Platte basin alone).</p>
			  <p>By using the NHD linked to Colorado water data, it is possible to link federal and State datasets.  Datasets such as 
			  stream gages, diversion structures and instream flow rights can be "referenced" to the SWRF to provide a common framework for analysis; 
			  such data work is ongoing in order to leverage the SWRF dataset.</p>
			  <p>The SWRF can be downloaded <a href="http://cdss.state.co.us/GIS/Pages/AllGISData.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			  <p><i>Map of SWRF will be shown at right.  <b>File size is 25 MB though.</b></i></p>

			  <p>This visualization, developed for the Colorado Water Conservation Board, provides access to a historical archive of Snow Data Assimilation 
			  System (SNODAS) data products for Colorado water supply basins.  <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/g02158SNODAS" target="_blank">SNODAS<img

			  Equivalent is the estimate of the depth of liquid water contained within the snowpack. Snow coverage is a percent of the basin land surface 
			  covered by snow (water bodies in the basin are ignored).  Mean SWE is displayed in the map using a legend similar to the National Weather Service.</p>
			  <p>Instructions for using this SNODAS tool can be found under the "About" tab in the upper left corner.  The visualization can also be viewed
