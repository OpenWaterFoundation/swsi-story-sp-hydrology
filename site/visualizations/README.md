# visualizations #

The `visualizations` folder contains the html, JavaScript, CSS and data files needed to create the visualizations shown in the Hydrology story. 
The visualizations in this folder are all line charts of hydrographs created with [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/).  Highcharts is a 
JavaScript library that allows for the creation of interactive charts that can be displayed in web pages.  This `visualizations` folder was 
created in order to make it easier to track which data files are the basis for the visualizations.  Any data-processing steps are described 
in the README for the `analysis` folder.

The folder contains the following files:

* [ag-diversion-hydrographs.html](#ag-diversion-hydrographshtml)
* [crop-irrigation-requirements.html](#crop-irrigation-requirementshtml)
* [envr-rec-flows.html](#envr-rec-flowshtml)
