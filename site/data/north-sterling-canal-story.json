The District typically begins to fill North Sterling Reservoir under its senior water right in the first week of October.  The reservoir will store water throughout the winter under its senior water right, up to 69,446 acre-feet.  Storage water is released to the North Sterling Outlet Canal for irrigation.  North Sterling State Park is located on the east side of the reservoir and is managed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife as a popular boating area."
